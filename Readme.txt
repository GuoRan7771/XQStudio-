维护与更新说明 (2026-02-01)
- 目的：个人使用，增加可开关的红/黑走法提示点，便于查看下一手落点。
- 新功能：工具栏开关按钮 + 快捷键 Z，可快速显示/隐藏当前一方所有候选落点（红/黑点），默认开启；已为按钮预留空间，不遮挡“上一手/下一手”等原有控件。
- 影响：仅界面呈现与交互，核心逻辑与存盘格式保持不变，便于日常复盘与演示。

Maintenance & Update (2026-02-01)
- Purpose: Personal use; add toggleable red/black move hint dots to preview next moves.
- Feature: Toolbar toggle button plus hotkey Z to show/hide all candidate targets for the side to move; default on; spacing adjusted so existing navigation buttons are unobstructed.
- Scope: UI-only display and interaction; core logic and save format unchanged, suitable for daily review and demos.
